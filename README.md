# Task List Program

The Task List Program is a simple command-line utility for managing your tasks. You can add, complete, and view tasks through an easy-to-use menu interface.

This project was just a small practice project for me to test out Python features for my upcoming PCAP certificate exam.

- Tasks are saved in a text file to keep the list between program runs

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-list-program.git

   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage your tasks.
